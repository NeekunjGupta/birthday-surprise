My love, it's your happy birthday in just 2 months! Omg I am freaking excited and I am happy we both will be together on it. Heheheh. 

I love you so so so so so much baby. You are the most precious thing and the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me. 

I am glad of this day — your birthday — because on this day you came for me, just for me, on this earth. 

I miss you baby princess. I love you so so so so much.
